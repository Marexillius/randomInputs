# Download all .py files to work

## RandomInputs.py
This file is the file to activate to make everything work. As a python noob, it's pretty cool.

## GamesInfo.py
This file is to insert input lists. 

If you want to add an input list, you must make or copy a function similar to gcnOutput and call it in the ButtonPress function (located in RandomInputs.py). You also need to make a new input list for the game and add both the list and a name for it in the "gameList" dictionnary found at the end of the code.

## ButtonVariables.py
This file is just to have variables of most keyboard keys as variables across the file. Not much to modify here.
